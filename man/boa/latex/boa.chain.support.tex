\begin{Description}\relax
Modifies the support (range of possible values) for the parameters in the
session lists of MCMC sequences.
\end{Description}
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
boa.chain.support(lnames, pnames, limits)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{lnames}] Character vector giving the names of the MCMC sequences over
which to apply the changes. If omitted, changes are applied to all sequences.
\item[\code{pnames}] Character vector giving the names of the parameters whose
support is to be modified.
\item[\code{limits}] Numeric vector with two elements giving the lower and upper
limits, respectively, of the support for the specified parameters. Unbounded
lower or upper limits should be specified as -Inf or Inf, respectively.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
\begin{Value}
A logical vector with two elements indicating that the support has been
changed for variables in the master list and working list of MCMC sequences,
respectively.
\end{Value}
\begin{Section}{Side Effects}
The support for each of the specified parameters is changed in the session
lists of MCMC sequences.
