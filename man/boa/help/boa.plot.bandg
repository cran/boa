_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Plots the Brooks and Gelman multivariate shrink factors within
     different line  segments across the MCMC sequences. This
     diagnostic is a multivariate  extension to the Gelman and Rubin
     shrink factors.

     annotate = boa.par("legend"))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    bins: Number of line segments within the MCMC sequence at which to
          plot  the Gelman and Rubin shrink factors. The first segment
          contains the first 50  iterations; the remaining iterations
          are partitioned into equal bins and added  incrementally to
          construct the remaining line segments. The shrink factors are
           plotted against the maximum iteration number for the
          segment. Cubic splines  are used to interpolate through the
          point estimates for each segment.

     win: Proportion of iterations to include in the Brooks, Gelman,
          and  Rubin Statistics.

annotate: Logical value indicating that a legend be included in the
          plot.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical value indicating that the plot was successfully created.
