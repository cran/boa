_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Starts the interactive menu for BOA.  Provides a menu-driven
     interface to all of the convergence diagnostics and statistical
     and graphical analysis tools.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.menu(recover = FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 recover: a logical value for use if the previous BOA menu session
          terminated unexpectedly.  It may be possible to crash the
          menu system by supplying the wrong type of data.  In the
          event of a crash, 'recover = TRUE' may be used to ensure that
          no data is lost.

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g:

     Do not use the 'recover' argument unless starting the menu
     immediately after a crash.

_N_o_t_e:

     'boa.menu' is the only function in the BOA library that need be
     called in order to use the menu-driven interface.
