_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Import data from an ASCII text file. The variables and iterations
     should appear in the columns and rows, respectively, of the file.
     The variable names must be given in the first row. The iteration
     numbers are taken from the the column entitled "iter"
     (case-sensitive), if it exists; otherwise, the numbers  1..n are
     used, where n is the number of rows. The columns may be separated
     by white space or tabs.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.importASCII(prefix, path = NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  prefix: Character string giving the prefix for the files in which the
           ASCII data is stored. boa.importASCII() looks for the file
          "prefix.txt".

    path: Character string giving the directory path in which the file
          subsides. This argument may be omitted if the file is located
          in the current working directory.  The specified path should
          not end with a slash(es).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If the data is successfully imported, a matrix is returned whose
     columns and rows contain the monitored parameters and the MCMC
     iterations, respectively. The iteration numbers and parameter
     names are stored in the dimnames of the  returned matrix.
     Otherwise, NULL is returned.
