_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Selects a subset of the MCMC sequences stored in the working
     session list of sequences.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.chain.subset(lnames, pnames, iter)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  lnames: Character vector giving the names of the MCMC sequences to
          include in the subset. If omitted, all sequences are
          included.

  pnames: Character vector giving the names of the parameters to
          include in the subset. If omitted, all parameters are
          included.

    iter: Character vector giving the names of the parameters to
          include in the subset. If omitted, all parameters are
          included.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical value indicating that the data has been successfully
     subsetted. If the requested subset contains no data, the working
     session list is not modified and FALSE is returned.

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     The subsetted data, if not an empty set, is copied to the working
     session list of MCMC sequences used in all analyses.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
