_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Adds an MCMC sequence to the session lists of sequences. Most
     users should not call this function directly. Passing improperly
     formatted data to this function will most likely break the
     functions in this library. The preferred method of adding a new
     sequence is to call the function 'boa.chain.import'.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.chain.add(link, lname)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    link: Matrix whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters and the MCMC iterations, respectively. The
          iteration numbers and parameter names must be assigned to
          'dimnames(link)'.

   lname: Character string giving the list name to use for the newly
          added MCMC sequence.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical value indicating that 'link' has been successfully
     added.
