_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Modifies the support (range of possible values) for the parameters
     in the session lists of MCMC sequences.

     boa.chain.support(lnames, pnames, limits)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  lnames: Character vector giving the names of the MCMC sequences over
          which to apply the changes. If omitted, changes are applied
          to all sequences.

  pnames: Character vector giving the names of the parameters whose
          support is to be modified.

  limits: Numeric vector with two elements giving the lower and upper
          limits, respectively, of the support for the specified
          parameters. Unbounded lower or upper limits should be
          specified as -Inf or Inf, respectively.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical vector with two elements indicating that the support has
     been changed for variables in the master list and working list of
     MCMC sequences, respectively.

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     The support for each of the specified parameters is changed in the
     session lists of MCMC sequences.
