_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    link: Matrix whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters and the MCMC iterations, respectively. The
          iteration numbers and parameter names must be assigned to
          'dimnames(link)'.

    size: Number of iterations to include in each batch.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix whose columns and rows contain the means within
     sequential batches and the monitored parameters, respectively.
