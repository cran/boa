_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Returns summary information from a list of MCMC sequences.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   chain: List of matrices whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters and the MCMC iterations, respectively. The
          iteration numbers and parameter names must be assigned to the
          dimnames.

chain.support: List of matrices whose columns and rows contain the
          monitored parameters and the support (lower and upper
          limits), respectively.

_V_a_l_u_e:

  lnames: Character vector giving the names of the MCMC sequences in
          the session list of sequences.

  pnames: List of character vectors giving the parameter names in each
          of the MCMC sequences.

    iter: List of numeric vectors giving the iterations from each MCMC
          sequence.

iter.range: Matrix whose columns give the range of the iterations for
          the MCMC sequences named in the rows.

 support: List of numeric vectors giving the support for the parameters
          in each of the MCMC sequences.
