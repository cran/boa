_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes summary statistics for the parameters in an MCMC
     sequence.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    link: Matrix whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters  and the MCMC iterations, respectively. The
          iteration numbers and parameter  names must be assigned to
          'dimnames(link)'.

   probs: Vector of probabilities at which to compute the quantiles. 
          Values must be between 0 and 1.

batch.size: Number of iterations to include in each batch when 
          computing batch means and lag-1 batch autocorrelations.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix whose columns and rows contain the summary statistics
     (i.e. sample  mean, standard deviation, naive standard error, MC
     error, batch standard error,  lag-1 batch autocorrelation,
     specified quantiles, minimum and maximum iteration  numbers, and
     total iterations in the sample) and the monitored parameters, 
     respectively.
