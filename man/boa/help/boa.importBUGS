_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  prefix: Character string giving the prefix for the files in which the
           BUGS output is stored. boa.importBUGS() looks for the two
          files "prefix.ind"  and "prefix.out".

    path: Character string giving the directory path in which the file
          subsides. This argument may be omitted if the file is located
          in the current working directory.  The specified path should
          not end with a slash(es).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If the data is successfully imported, a matrix is returned whose
     columns and  rows contain the monitored parameters and the MCMC
     iterations, respectively.  The iteration numbers and parameter
     names are stored in the dimnames of the  returned matrix.
     Otherwise, NULL is returned.
