_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Extracts and sets the MCMC sequence(s) stored internally for use
     during a BOA session. Users can safely use this function to
     extract data. However, it should not be called directly to modify
     the stored MCMC sequence(s). Instead, data management should
     accomplished with the libboa.chain functions.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.chain(...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     ...: A list may be given as the only argument, or a character
          string given as the only argument, or any number of arguments
          may be in the '<name> = <value>' form, or no argument at all
          may be given. See the Value and Side Effects sections for
          further details.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If no arguments are supplied, a list of the current values is
     returned. If a character string is given, the current value of the
     named variable is returned. Otherwise, no values are returned.

     _m_a_s_t_e_r = _l_i_s_t() Master list containing all added MCMC sequences.
          Sequences may only be added to or deleted from the master
          list. The sequences in this list are never modified or used
          in any of the analyses. It serves as a template for the
          working list described below. The parameters and iterations
          may differ between the sequences. Each element in the list is
          a matrix whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters and the MCMC iterations, respectively. The
          iteration numbers and parameter names are stored in the
          dimnames.

     _m_a_s_t_e_r._s_u_p_p_o_r_t = _l_i_s_t() List containing the support for each of
          the parameters in 'master'. Each element in the list is a
          matrix whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters and the support (lower and upper limits),
          respectively. The default for each parameter is c(-Inf, Inf).

     _w_o_r_k = _m_a_s_t_e_r Working list used in all analyses. This list is
          essentially a modifiable copy of 'master'. All data
          management functions operate on the working list.

     _w_o_r_k._s_u_p_p_o_r_t = _m_a_s_t_e_r._s_u_p_p_o_r_t List containing the support for each
          of the parameters in 'work'.

     _w_o_r_k._s_y_n_c = _T_R_U_E Logical value indicating that the working list is
          an identical copy of the master list. This variable is
          automatically set to F after a successful call to
          'boa.chain.subset' or  'boa.chain.collapse'. While 'work.sync
          = F', only the master list will be updated if MCMC sequences
          are added or deleted. A call to 'boa.chain.reset' will reset
          this variable to T and copy the master list to the working
          list.

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     When variables are set, boa.chain() modifies the internal list
     '.boa.chain'. If boa.chain() is called with either a list as the
     single argument, or with one or more arguments in the '<name> =
     <value>' form, the variables specified by the names in the
     arguments are modified.
