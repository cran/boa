     The Line example involves a linear regression analysis of the data
     points (1,1), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and (5,5).  The proposed
     Bayesian model is

                         y[i] ~ N(mu[i], tau)


              mu[i] = alpha + beta * (x[i] - mean(x[]))

     with the following priors:

                         alpha ~ N(0, 0.0001)


                         beta ~ N(0, 0.0001)


                      tau ~ Gamma(0.001, 0.001)

     Two parallel chains from the MCMC sampler were generated and the
     output saved in the  S data frames line1 and line2.
