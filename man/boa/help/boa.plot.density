_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Estimates and displays, in a single plot, the density function(s)
     for the  specified parameter(s).

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.plot.density(lnames, pname, bandwidth = boa.par("bandwidth"),
     window = boa.par("kernel"), annotate = boa.par("legend"))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  lnames: Character vector giving the names of the desired MCMC
          sequence  in the working session list of sequences.

   pname: Character string giving the name of the parameter to be
          plotted.

bandwidth: Function for computing the bandwidth used in estimating the 
          density functions for parameters. This should take one
          argument which is a  numeric vector of data on which density
          estimation is to be performed. A  constant bandwidth may be
          specified by having this function return the desired 
          constant.

  window: Character string giving the type of window used in estimating
           the density functions for the parameters. Available choices
          are "cosine",  "gaussian", "rectangular", or "triangular".

annotate: Logical value indicating that a legend be included in the
          plot.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical value indicating that the plot was successfully created.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
