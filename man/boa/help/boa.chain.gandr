_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes the Gelman and Rubin convergence diagnostics for a list
     of MCMC sequences. Estimates are calculated from the second half
     of each sequence.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.chain.gandr(chain, chain.support, alpha, pnames, window, to)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   chain: List of matrices whose columns and rows contain the monitored
          parameters and the MCMC iterations, respectively. The
          iteration numbers and parameter names must be assigned to the
          dimnames.

chain.support: List of matrices whose columns and rows contain the
          monitored parameters and the support (lower and upper
          limits), respectively.

   alpha: Quantile (1 - alpha / 2) at which to estimate the upper limit
          of the shrink factor.

  pnames: Character vector giving the names of the parameters to use in
          the analysis. If omitted, all parameters are used.

  window: Proportion of interations to include in the analysis. If
          omitted, 50% are included.

      to: Largest iteration to include in the analysis. If omitted, no
          upper bound is set.

_V_a_l_u_e:

    psrf: A vector containing the Gelman and Rubin (uncorrected)
          potential scale reduction factors for the monitored
          parameters.

    csrf: A matrix whose columns and rows are the Gelman and Rubin
          corrected scale reduction factors (i.e. shrink factor
          estimates at the median and specified quantile of the
          sampling distribution) and the monitored parameters,
          respectively. A correction of (df + 3) / (df + 1) is applied
          to the scale reduction factors.

   mpsrf: A numeric value giving the multivariate potential scale
          reduction factor proposed by Brooks and Gelman.

  window: A numeric vector with two elements giving the range of the
          iterations used in the analysis.
