_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Creates a single plot of the Geweke convergence diagnostics within
     different  line segments for a parameter in an MCMC sequence.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.plot.geweke(lname, pname, bins = boa.par("geweke.bins"), p.first = boa.par("geweke.first"), p.last = boa.par("geweke.last"), alpha = boa.par("alpha"), annotate = boa.par("legend"))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   lname: Character string giving the name of the desired MCMC sequence
          in  the working session list of sequences.

   pname: Character string giving the name of the parameter to be
          plotted.

    bins: Number of line segments within the MCMC sequence at which to
          plot  the Geweke convergence diagnostics. The ith line
          segment contains the last  ((bins - i + 1) / bins)*100 bins.
          This may lead to segments in which there are too few
          iterations to  compute the convergence diagnostics. Such
          segments, if they exist, are  automatically omitted from the
          calculations.

 p.first: Proportion of iterations to include in the first window.

  p.last: Proportion of iterations to include in the last window.

   alpha: Alpha level for the rejection region lines drawn on the
          graph.

annotate: Logical value indicating that a legend be included in the
          plot.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical value indicating that the plot was successfully created.
