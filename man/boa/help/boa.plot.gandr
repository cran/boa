_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Creates a single plot of the Gelman and Rubin shrink factors
     within different  line segments for a parameter in an MCMC
     sequence.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     boa.plot.gandr(pname, bins = boa.par("gandr.bins"), alpha = boa.par("alpha"),
     win = boa.par("gandr.win"), annotate = boa.par("legend"))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   pname: Character string giving the name of the parameter in the
          working  session list of MCMC sequences to be plotted.

    bins: Number of line segments within the MCMC sequence at which to
          plot  the Gelman and Rubin shrink factors. The first segment
          contains the first 50  iterations; the remaining iterations
          are partitioned into equal bins and  added incrementally to
          construct the remaining line segments. The shrink  factors
          are plotted against the maximum iteration number for the
          segment.  Cubic splines are used to interpolate through the
          point estimates for each  segment.

   alpha: Quantile (1 - alpha / 2) at which to estimate the upper limit
          of  the shrink factor.

     win: Proportion of iterations to include in the Brooks, Gelman,
          and  Rubin Statistics.

annotate: Logical value indicating that a legend be included in the
          plot.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A logical value indicating that the plot was successfully created.
